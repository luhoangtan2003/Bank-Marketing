4. Relevant Information:

   The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.
   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often; more than one contact to the same client was required;
   in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

   There are two datasets:
      1) Bank Full.csv with all examples; ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).
      2) Bank.csv with 10% of the examples (4521); randomly selected from Bank Full.csv.
   The smallest dataset is provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).

   The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

5. Number of Instances: 45211 for Bank Full.csv (4521 for bank.csv)

6. Number of Attributes: 16 + output attribute.
